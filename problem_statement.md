Title: Decentralized Patient-Centered Clinical Trial Platform

Overview:
We are building a patient-centered clinical trial platform that integrates blockchain, AI, and finance to create transparency, trust, and fairness in medical research.

The Problem:

Clinical trial data can be manipulated or delayed, eroding investor and public trust.

Patients often contribute valuable time and health data without fair compensation or insights.

Self-reported data is prone to errors or dishonesty, lowering trial reliability.

Investors / Sponsors

-Fund the trials.

Funding is released based on milestones defined in blockchain smart contracts.

Can see trial progress transparently.

Reduces risk of overpaying for incomplete or faulty trials.
To give you all an overview and what I mean by milestones

Our Solution:
A decentralized system where:

Blockchain ensures data integrity, secures patient consent, and powers smart contracts that release funding only when milestones are achieved.

AI analyzes clinical and wearable data in real time, generating personalized health insights for patients and transparent progress reports for researchers and investors.

Finance Layer (Token Economy): Patients earn tokens for verified participation (surveys, wearable uploads, lab results), which can be redeemed for healthcare services or rewards. Investors fund trials via milestone-based smart contracts, reducing financial risk.

Patient Dashboard: Patients track their token balance, view AI-powered health insights, and control data access with transparent permissions.

Impact:

Patients are empowered and incentivized as active stakeholders in trials.

Researchers gain access to higher-quality, verifiable data.

Investors have greater confidence with milestone-based funding and transparent results.

The healthcare ecosystem becomes more trustworthy, transparent, and efficient.

Your OBJECTIVE: Plan and build a Blockchain DApp using Midnight and compact

UNDERSANDING
We have a patient who is participating in a clinical trial (usually not compensated well
contributes data
We have Researchers(Conducting clinical trial)-receive the data from patients
We have investors who are sponsor the research project(usually paying both patients and researchers)
Sponsors project

Problem(s):
patients do not get compensated well for their contributions(data)
Data can be altered or any errors may compromise it's integrity

To fix this:
use blockchain to create contracts, that will determine how patients are compensated
fairly, data integrity maintained due to privacy feature and payments automated

AI:
PAtients: Provides personalized healtyh insights
Researchers: Trial progress (insights)
