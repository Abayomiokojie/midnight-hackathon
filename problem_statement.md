## Decentralized Patient-Centered Clinical Trial Platform

### Overview

We are building a patient-centered clinical trial platform that combines blockchain, AI, and a tokenized finance layer to deliver transparency, trust, and fair compensation in medical research.

### Problem Statement

- Clinical trial data can be manipulated, delayed, or lost, which erodes public and investor trust.
- Patients frequently contribute time and sensitive health data but receive little compensation or actionable feedback.
- Self-reported and unverified data introduces errors and reduces the reliability of study outcomes.

### Stakeholders

- Patients: contribute data and participate in trials; need fair compensation, privacy, and actionable feedback.
- Researchers: run trials and need high-quality, verifiable data and transparent progress tracking.
- Investors / Sponsors: fund trials and need mechanisms to reduce financial risk and verify milestone completion.

### Key Idea (Milestone-based Funding)

Use blockchain smart contracts to define trial milestones. Funds are released automatically when milestones are verifiably met. This reduces the chance of overpaying for incomplete or falsified work and creates a transparent audit trail for all parties.

### Proposed Solution

1. Blockchain layer

   - Store consent, proofs of data integrity, and milestone definitions on-chain.
   - Use smart contracts to hold funds in escrow and release payments when milestones are satisfied.

2. AI layer

   - Analyze clinical, wearable, and survey data in real time.
   - Provide personalized health insights to patients and trial-progress summaries to researchers and sponsors.
   - Generate verifiable signals (e.g., aggregated metrics, anomaly detection) that feed milestone verification.

3. Finance / Token economy

   - Issue tokens to patients for verified participation (completed surveys, verified wearable uploads, lab results).
   - Tokens are redeemable for healthcare services, credits, or other rewards.
   - Sponsors fund trials via milestone-based smart contracts to reduce financial risk.

4. Patient Dashboard
   - Allow patients to view token balances, activity history, and AI-driven insights.
   - Manage data access and consent with clear, auditable permissions.

### Impact

- Patients become empowered, compensated, and engaged stakeholders in trials..
- Researchers access higher-quality, verifiable datasets.
- Investors gain confidence from transparent, milestone-driven funding and verifiable progress.
- Overall, clinical trials become more trustworthy, efficient, and equitable.

### Objective

Plan and build a Blockchain DApp using Midnight and compact that implements the solution above.

### Understanding (Actors & Data Flow)

- Patient: registers, consents, and uploads data (wearables, surveys, lab results).
- Researcher: defines trial, sets milestones, requests/consumes data (with patient consent).
- Sponsor/Investor: funds the trial by depositing funds into a smart contract tied to milestone definitions.
- Smart Contracts: hold funds, validate milestone proofs, and release payments.

### Problems to Solve

- Fair compensation for patients for their data and participation.
- Data integrity and provenance to prevent alteration or tampering.
- Automated, auditable payment flow tied to verifiable trial milestones.

### How Blockchain + AI Fix These

- Blockchain: immutable records for consent, data hashes, and milestone payments; automated escrow and payout.
- AI: continuous validation, enrichment, and generation of verifiable trial signals and personalized insights.

### AI Use Cases

- For Patients: personalized health insights, adherence reminders, anomaly alerts.
- For Researchers: aggregated trial progress metrics, data quality scoring, anomaly detection, and milestone verification signals.

### Next Steps (Suggested Implementation Plan)

1. Define on-chain contract interfaces and milestone schema (using compact / Midnight tools).
2. Design data ingestion and verification pipeline (wearables, surveys, labs) with privacy-preserving hashes and proofs.
3. Build AI analytics pipeline for real-time signals and insights.
4. Implement token economics and patient dashboard (web UI + wallet integration).
5. Test end-to-end: simulate trial, verify milestone payouts, validate data provenance.

### Assumptions & Open Questions

- Assume Midnight and compact provide tooling for smart contracts, proofs, and zk-friendly flows.
- Decide token model: fungible token, stable-credit, or off-chain rewards convertible on demand.
- Define regulatory/privacy requirements per target jurisdiction (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
